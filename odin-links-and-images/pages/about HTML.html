    <h1>About HTML</h1>
	<p>Create a directory named pages within the odin-links-and-images directory and move the about.html file into this new directory.</p>

	<p>Refresh the index page in the browser and then click on the about link. It will now be broken. This is because the location of the about page file has changed.</p>

	<p>To fix this, we just need to update the about link href value to include the pages/ directory since that is the new location of the about file relative to the index file.</p>
